These are the repositories for the second-year high school research project of the student from Dr Puigvert Biel Alt√©s Grifoll Institute.

The PDF of the project can be found in the main directory. Each folder corresponds to the main topics of the project:
* Initialization: Mathematical basis (backpropagation, perceptron...)
* Deep learning with Tensorflow and Keras: Introduction through simple Tensorflow projects.
* Final project, AI driving video games: Project using Tensorflow to create a bot that drives Assetto Corsa.
* Latest advances around the world: Curiosities and latest news (2020)

I would recommend watching the videos of the final result of the Assetto Corsa AI section.
